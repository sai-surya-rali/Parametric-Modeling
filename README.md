Parametric Blade Wheel Modeling:

 This project showcases a parametric modeling experiment conducted in Siemens NX. A generic "Blade Wheel" model was created and parameterized to derive two distinct variants: "Fan Wheel" and "Compressor Wheel." The workflow involved defining geometric dependencies, creating part families, and implementing design rules to automate features like variant-specific outer rings and personalized text embossing. The project highlights advanced CAD modeling techniques for flexible, rule-based design adaptation.
